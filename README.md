Nutritional cost efficiency
As someone of a tall stature and an interest in working out, efficient nutrition is a major factor in my personal life. This means that, at the best of times, my food expenses can be significant; especially when trying to restrict myself to healthy food.

The recent(2022) inflation crisis has made it an even more pressing issue, which lead me to the following project idea: Collect a set of data from which one can derive the prices as well as the nutritional value of different products. I haven't been able to find a repository with such data easily navigable anywhere online.

So why not make one?
